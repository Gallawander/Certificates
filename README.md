# Certificates
#### Certificates I obtained through MOOC
I have taken several online courses to learn programming in R and Python and master the best practices in data science. To complete my data science skills I also learned fundamentals in SQL. To extend my programming skills I learned HTML & CSS, together with JavaScript.

# Certificates
**Certificates I obtained through MOOC**. I have taken several online courses to learn programming in R and Python and master the best practices in data science. To complete my data science skills I also learned fundamentals in SQL. In addition, to extend my programming skills, I learned HTML & CSS, as well as the fundamentals of JavaScript. I will keep adding more certificates after completing the courses.
